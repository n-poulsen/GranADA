# Localized Markets; Food and Agricultural Organization

# Abstract

We want to use the FAO's datasets to look at how global trade of agricultural produce has changed over the years, and how it could change in the future. Our goal is to determine how food production can be made more local. We will be exploring what factors that drive food globalization, such as local and global trends in food consumption. Ideally, we would base our analysis on how countries produced food in the past, as we believe, before much analysis, that food used to be grown more locally. 

We want to explain the changes in global food production over the years, and explore possibilities of going back to simpler trade models. This would be done while taking into account population changes over time, as well as environmental constraints, such as arable land. We want to highlight redundant trade routes, driven by purely economical factors. Does centralized food production (in a small number of countries) make produce availability less resilient?



# Research questions
Here is a list of questions we hope to address during the project.

* How much of the global food production can be made local?
* How does trade and international production change based on global prices, and vice-versa?
* How has global agricultural trade changed over the years?
* How does the global market respond to local food shortages?


# Dataset
List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
These are the datasets we plan on using:
* FAO Production: Crops http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC
* FAO Production: Value of Agricultural Production  http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QV
* FAO Trade: Crops and livestock products http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TP
* FAO Prices: Producer Prices - Annual  http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/PP

All of these datasets are in CSV format. We might need to enrich them with other FAO datasets. We might need to normalize these datasets by country population in the future, which would require more data.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

* November 03rd: 
  * Merge all datasets into one, and set up global and local notebooks for all team members.
  * Each team member should choose which research question to explore.
  * Determine if more datasets are necessary.
  * Choose which items (crops) we will focus on.
* November 10th: 
  * Explore each research question: Are we going to be able to answer them? Try to get useful information and start extracting it from the dataset.
  * Create intersting graphs and visualizations, and find interesting facts in the data.
* November 17th: 
  * Finish work on each individual research question.
  * Explain to other team members our conclusions and try to see how everything fits together.
  * Explore the notebooks of other tesam members.
* November 24th: 
  * Merge work together, and link all research questions.
  * Develop ideas for what we will want to include in our data story.
* November 25th: Milestone 02


# Questions for TAa
* Are we allowed to make certain "researched" assumptions:
  * Could we say that if one country produces a lot of a certain crop, and a neighboring country with the same climate doesn't produce any, that they have the potential to start producing that crop?
  * Can we make suggestions for how localized food production could look like for "example" countries?


# What we expect to do for milestone 3

After preprocessing the data and done different analysis on it, we decided to follow the structure below for the final data story. The structure goes from a general overview of globalization and then goes deeper into the analysis of regions, then even more specifically some products.

1. **Globalization over the years:**
  * How has trade changed between 1993 and 2016?
  * In which countries have the import/export production increased over the years? 
  * Which countries trade the most between each other?
  * Are some countries marginalized?

2. **Regions:**
  * Here we would start making the link with the them social good by analyzing the trades between some regions and the rest of the world and finding out whether these regions have been marginalized

3. **Specific products:**
  * Study quinoa: where was it consumed in 1993, where it is consumed now, how prices have evolved.
  * Focus on one type of food for the moment and then see how deep the analysis can get

## Timeline for milestone 3

* December 1st: Finish step number 1 in the structure 
* December 8th: Finish step 2 and 3 in the structure
* Starting December 9th: Start working on the data story

# Milestone 3

The plan we set up for the data story after milestone 2 was altered. We discovered many interesting facts about certain types of food and how they were affected by globalization. Therefore, we followed up on that and rearranged the structure to look like the following:

1. **Introduction: Food Globlization**
  * How has trade changed between 1993 and 2016?
  * Are there any patterns that stand out?
  * Identify trade giants
  
2. **Soy: animal feed**
  * China : the main importer of soybeans in the world
  * What are soybeans used for in 
  * The rise of Brazil as one of the biggest exporters of soybeans
  * Soybean production part of the reasons behind deforestation in the Amazon (**Social good**)
 
3. **Sesame seeds: small producers**
  * Imports of sesame seeds in the world : the surge in imports from Africa to China
  * What is the reason behind this increase? (**Social good**)

4. **Avocados: government bans**
  * USA/Mexico trade relations with the introduction of NAFTA
  * 

5. **Quinoa: consumer demand**
  * Worldwide boom
